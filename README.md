# XTools
Suite of general tools that lack a dedicated repo.

Currently a general collection of generally useful scripts to ease sharing with collaborators.

Note: Use at your own risk. Most scripts provide information when calling without "options/flags".

## Codon_Genetic_Code
Contains scripts tied to codon usage bias, parsing GTFs (for absolute strand polarity), and evaluating genetic codes.
