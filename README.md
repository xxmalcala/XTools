# XTools
Suite of general tools that lack a dedicated repo.

Currently a general collection of generally useful scripts to ease sharing with collaborators.

Note: Use at your own risk. Most scripts provide information when calling without "options/flags".

## CodonsGeneticCode
Contains scripts tied to codon usage bias, parsing GTFs (for absolute strand polarity), and evaluating genetic codes.

## GTST
Folder contains scripts for preparing data for analyses with gene-tree species-tree reconciliation (ASTRAL and GeneRax).

## PhylogenyTools
Folder contains scripts related to phylogenetic tree walking and renaming tips.

## NoHome
Folder for current "orphan" scripts (i.e. one-offs).
